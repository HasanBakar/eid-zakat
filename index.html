            <h1>Let's Finish Your Internal Evil</h1>
            <p>With three days long celebration and excitement of Eid-Ul-Adha, it is the second biggest religious
                festival
                of the Muslim community. Also known as the Muslim's feast of sacrifice or Festival of sacrifice, this
                celebration starts with several delicious traditional dishes made with love. Muslims across the globe
                celebrate together and honor the willingness of Ibrahim to sacrifice his son for Allah. This festival is
                celebrated with enough fervour and delight as people dress up nicely and visit each other's homes to
                spread
                happiness, laughter, cheer and of course, sweets!</p>

            <p>Yet, this is also the first step and the basic and broadest ground to enable human beings to reach the
